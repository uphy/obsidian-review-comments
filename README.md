# Obsidian Review Comments

> 日本語版 README: [README.ja.md](./README.ja.md)

Notion-style review comments for Obsidian. Select text, click the floating button, and add a comment. Comments are stored directly in `.md` files as **CriticMarkup**, so Claude / GPT can read the file and apply the requested edits without any export step.

## Comment format

```markdown
The original {==text==}{>>shirai|2026-05-13: please rewrite<<} has an issue.
```

- `{==...==}` — highlighted span (rendered in yellow)
- `{>>author|date: comment<<}` — comment metadata

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShotaShirai1719/obsidian-review-comments.git
cd obsidian-review-comments
npm install
npm run build
```

This produces `main.js`.

## Install

Let `$VAULT` be the absolute path to your Obsidian vault:

```bash
mkdir -p "$VAULT/.obsidian/plugins/review-comments"
cp main.js manifest.json styles.css "$VAULT/.obsidian/plugins/review-comments/"
```

Or, for development, symlink the working directory:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)" "$VAULT/.obsidian/plugins/review-comments"
```

Then in Obsidian:

1. Settings → Community plugins → enable **Review Comments**
2. Settings → Review Comments → set `Author name` to your own name

## Usage

1. Drag-select a span of text
2. Click the **💬 Comment** button that appears near the selection
3. Enter your comment in the modal. Multiline notes and bullet lists are supported.

Alternatively:

- Select text → Command palette → `Review Comments: Add comment to selection`
- Assign a hotkey (recommended: `Cmd + Shift + M`)

## Side panel

Open the comments panel from the left ribbon (speech-bubble icon) or via `Review Comments: Open comments panel`.

- Click a card or `Jump` → jump to the corresponding location in the document
- `Resolve` button → replace `{==text==}{>>...<<}` with `text` (deletes the comment, keeps the original text)

## AI integration

Pass the `.md` file directly to Claude Code or another LLM with a prompt like:

> Apply the edits described in the CriticMarkup comments (`{==...==}{>>...<<}`) in this file. Remove the CriticMarkup once each comment has been applied, and restore the highlighted spans to plain text.

This closes the loop: comment in Obsidian → hand off to an LLM → get a clean diff back.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev   # watch mode
npm run build # production build
```
